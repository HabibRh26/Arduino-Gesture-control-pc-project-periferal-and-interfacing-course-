# Gesture-control-pc-Arduino-project-
## Introduction :
This repository contains the Course Project titled **Gesture-control-pc-Arduino-project** which was developed for the sake of **Computer Periferals and Interfacing Lab** course in 3rd year 2nd semester of my Undergraduate degree and the course was supervised by **Dr.Morium Akter**. 
## Project Summary:
Hand gesture uses Arduino Uno,Ultrasonic Sensor and Laptop to carry out the operation of controlling media playback and volume.It is mainly aimed at reducing the effort of interaction with computers through input devices using simple gestures.It also helps to increase the interaction with computers.
